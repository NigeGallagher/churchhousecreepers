# Church House Creepers

Church House Creepers is a website for an up-and-coming punk band from Sligo, Ireland. The site will be tagerted towards punk and rock music fans who would like to listen to the bands music and keep up-to-date with their upcoming live shows. The site should also give a flavour of the bands style and personality.

## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero and large background image on the landing page was chosen to immediatly give a sense of the bands grungy style.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A vibrant green was taken from the glitchy image I created in Photoshop to complement the clean, strong blank and white pallete.

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Bebas Neue and Courier fonts into styles.css.  These were chosen as they work well together and the Bebas font is punchy and heavy which suits the bands style.


-   ### Wireframes

    -   #### Main Page Wireframes
